# Covid-Fighter-Game

This is a small game that works with the help of mouse clicks. <br> Since COVID19 is a huge villain for the year 2020, so our superhero will defend all the covid particles and will reach to the gem.<br> This project is a part of Data Structures in Real Life course by Coding Blocks that is helping me implement the data structures like arrays, stack que's, dynamic programming etc in real life projects.<br> Thank You
